<h2>Functions</h2>
<br /> <br />

<h4>Small</h4>
<p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.</p><br />

<h4>Blocks and Indenting</h4>
<p>This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. <br />
The functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two. This, of course, makes the functions easier to read and understand.</p><br />

<h4>Do One Thing</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>One Level of Abstraction per Function</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Reading Code from Top to Bottom</h5>
    We want the code to read like a top-down narrative. We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions.
