<h1>Comments</h1><br />

<p>
    Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment.
    The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in coded.
</p>

<h3>Comments do no make up for bad code</h3>

<h3>Explain yourself in code</h3>

<h3>Good Comments</h3>
<h4>Legal Comments</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes our corporate coding standards force us to write certain comments for leagal reasons. For example, copyright and authorship statements are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source file.
    Comments like this should not be contracts or legal tomes. Where possible, refer to a standard license or other external document rather than putting all the terms and conditions into the comment.
</p>
<h4>Informative Comments</h4>
<p>
    It is sometimes useful to provide basic information with a comment. 
</p>
<h4>Explanation of Intent</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision.
</p>
<h4>Clarification</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes it is just helpful to translate the meaning of some obscure argument or return value into something that's readable. In general it is better to find a way to make that argument or return value clear in its own right; but when its part of the standard library, or in code that you cannot alter, then a helpful clarifying comment can be useful.
</p>
<h4>Warning of Consequences</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes it is useful to warn other programmers about certain consequences.
</p>
<h4>TODO Comments</h4>
<p>
    It is sometimes reasonable to leave "To Do" notes in the form of //TODO comments.

    TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason can't do at the moment. It might be a reminder to delte a deprecated feature or a plea for someone else to look at a problem.
</p>
<h4>Amplification</h4>
<p>
    A comment may be used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.
</p>

<h3>Javadocs in Public APIs</h3>
<p>
    There is nothing quite so helpful and satisfying as a well-described public API. The javadocs for the standard Java library are a case in point. It would be difficult, at best, to write Java programs without them.
</p>

<h3>BAD Comments</h3>
<h4>Mumbling</h4>
<p>
    Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the process requires it, is a hack. If you decide to write a comment, then spend the time necessary to make sure it is the best comment you can write.
</p>
<h4>Redundant Comments</h4>
<p>
    If you comment the same obvious stuff that can be read from code, then its not good.
</p>
<p>
    Don't use comment when you can use a function or a variable
</p>
<p>
    No Commented Out Code
</p>
<p>
    Non-Local Information
