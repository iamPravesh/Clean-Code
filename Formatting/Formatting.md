<h3>Virtical Formatting</h3>

<h3>The Newspaper Metaphor</h3>
<p>We would like a source file to be like a newspaper article. The name should be simple but explanatory. The name, by itself, should be sufficient tot tell us whether we are in the right module or not. The topmost parts of the source file should provide the high-level concepts and algorithms. Detail should increase as we move downward, until at the end we find the lowest level functions and details in the source file.</p>

<h3>Virtical Openness Between Concepts</h3>

<h3>Dependent Functions</h3>
<p>If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible.</p>
