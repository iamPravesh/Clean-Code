# Meaningful Name
<br />

<h3>Use Intention-Revealing Names</h3>
<p>Choosing goood name takes time but saves more than it takes. Choose the names that will tell what the variables actually represents. Instead of using theList as the variable name for a list of user, use the name "userList" or such that reveals the intention.</p><br />

<h3>Avoid Disinformation</h3>
<p>We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intendedd meaning.  For example, if you are coding a hypotenuse and hp looks like a good abbreviation, it could be disinformative</p><br />

<h3>Make Meaningful Distinctions</h3>
<p>Distinguish names a such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.In the absence of specific conventions, the variable moneyAmount it is indistinguishable from money, customerInfo is indistinguishable from customer, accountData is indistinguishable from account, and theMessage is indistinguishable from message, although they mean different things.</p><br />

<h3>Use Pronounceable Names</h3>
<p>!!!MAKE YOUR NAMES PRONOUNCEABLES</p><br />

<h3>Use Searchable Names</h3>
<p>Suppose, we need to use number of days in a week in the code. We can use the number 7 wherever needed, but it can mean anything depending on the context. Instead, make a constant(like NUMBER_OF_DAYS_IN_WEEK) and use it wherever needed. </p> <br />

<h3>Avoid Encodings</h3><br />

<h3>Avoid Mental Mapping</h3><br />

<h3>Don't Be Cute</h3>
<p>Choose clarity over entertainment value. Say what you mean and mean what you say</p><br />

<h3>Pick One Word Per Concept</h3>
<p>A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.</p><br />

<h3>Don't Pun</h3>
<p>Dont use the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.</p><br />

<h3>Use Solution Domain Names</h3>
<p>Use Conmputer Science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth. Choose technical names.</p><br />

<h3>Use Problem Domain Name</h3>
<p>When there is no "programmer-esse" for what you're doing, use the name from the problem domain.</p><br />

<h3>Add Meaningful Context</h3>
<p>There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves, most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in w ell-named classes, functions, or namespace.</p><br />

<h3>Don't Add Gratutious Context</h3>
<p>The shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more ocntext to a name than is necessary.</p>
