<h1>Unit Tests</h1>

<h3>The Three Laws of TDD</h3>
<p>
    First Law: You may not write production code unitl you have written a failing unit test. <br/>
    Second Law: You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing. <br/>
    Third Law: You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test
</p>

<h3>Keeping Tests Clean</h3>
<p>
    Test code is just as important as production code. It is not a second-class citizen. It requires thought, design, and care. It must be kept as clean as production code.
</p>

<h3>Tests Enable the -ilities</h3>
<p>
    If your tests are dirty, then your ability to change your code is hampered, and you begin to lose the ability to improve the structure of that code. The dirtier your tests, the dirtier your code becomes. Eventually you lose the tests, and your code rots.
</p>

<h3>Clean Tests</h3>
<p>
    Readability, readability, and readability. 
</p>

<h3>F.I.R.S.T</h3>
<p>
    Fast <br/>
    Independent <br/>
    Repeatable <br/>
    Self-Validating <br/>
    Timely 
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Test are as important to the health of a project as the production code is. Perhaps they are even more important, because tests preserve and enhance the flexibility,, maintainability, and reusability of the production code. So keep your tests constantly clean. Work to make them expressive and succinct. Invent testing APIs that act as domain-specific language that helps you write the code.
